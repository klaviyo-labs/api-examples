# Reporting API code examples
This folder is part of the api-examples repository and contains practical code snippets demonstrating common use cases for the Klaviyo Reporting API. Our goal is to provide clear, ready-to-use examples that align with the scenarios outlined in the [Reporting API Overview](https://developers.klaviyo.com/en/reference/reporting_api_overview).

## What's inside?
Each file within this folder corresponds to a specific use case, making it easy to find and implement the functionality you need. These examples illustrate how to pull reports and analyze behavior of your Klaviyo flows, campaigns, sign-up forms, and segments.

This folder also contains the reporting_apis_youtube folder, which contains the code used in the [Analyze marketing performance with reporting APIs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tM0wmuNnukU) YouTube video.

The Python and JavaScript examples use Klaviyo's SDKs:
- [Python SDK](https://github.com/klaviyo/klaviyo-api-python)
- [Node SDK](https://github.com/klaviyo/klaviyo-api-node)

## How to use These examples
- Browse by use case: Navigate to find the specific reporting scenario you're interested in. Each use case has a corresponding shell script as well as Python and JavaScript examples.
- Review the code: Each example includes comments to explain the logic and structure of the API call.
- Adapt to your needs: Copy the relevant code snippet and modify it with your conversion metric IDs, timeframe of interest, flow IDs, etc.
- Integrate and test: Integrate the code into your application or website and test thoroughly to ensure you are pulling the correct data with the reporting APIs.

## Contributing
We welcome contributions! If you have a common use case not yet covered, or an improvement to an existing example, please feel free to open a pull request.
