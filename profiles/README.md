# Profiles API Code Examples
This folder is part of the api-examples repository and contains practical code snippets demonstrating common use cases for the Klaviyo Profiles API. Our goal is to provide clear, ready-to-use examples that align with the scenarios outlined in the [Profiles API Overview](https://developers.klaviyo.com/en/reference/profiles_api_overview).

## What's Inside?
Each file within this folder corresponds to a specific use case, making it easy to find and implement the functionality you need. These examples illustrate how to track and analyze various customer behaviors within Klaviyo.

This folder also contains the create_profiles_youtube and get_profiles_youtube folders, which contains the code used in the [Create and update a Klaviyo profile via API](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lir9g0pQfCM&list=PLHkNfHgtxcUanrkMnKPdkRzuWU7MGv_xM) and [Get profiles out of Klaviyo via API](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHXJlV7wP0Q&list=PLHkNfHgtxcUanrkMnKPdkRzuWU7MGv_xM) YouTube videos.

The Python and JavaScript examples use Klaviyo's SDKs:
- [Python SDK](https://github.com/klaviyo/klaviyo-api-python)
- [Node SDK](https://github.com/klaviyo/klaviyo-api-node)

## How to Use These Examples
- Browse by Use Case: Navigate to find the specific event scenario you're interested in. Each use case has a corresponding shell script as well as Python and JavaScript examples.
- Review the Code: Each example includes comments to explain the logic and structure of the API call.
- Adapt to Your Needs: Copy the relevant code snippet and modify it with your specific API keys, event names, property values, etc.
- Integrate and Test: Integrate the code into your application or website and test thoroughly to ensure events are being tracked correctly in Klaviyo.
